(Project was done as my first year final project)
To streamline company "Nils Store's" current manual workflow and business document processes, we implemented a new web application. The web app will gradually replace the existing system, offering a range of benefits and improvements. The primary goals of the Nils web application are to enhance productivity and efficiency by providing faster output speed, ensuring robust data security, and delivering an intuitive and user-friendly interface. By automating processes and centralizing data management, the web application will optimize workflow management, improve decision-making capabilities, and provide a seamless experience for the users. Additionally, the web app will enable Nils to adapt to changing business needs, enhance collaboration among teams, and ultimately drive growth and success in the competitive women's clothing industry.
